## INSTALLATION

Tested with RTX 2060 and GTX 1660 Ti versions, both [share same hardware specs](https://topics-cdn.dell.com/pdf/g-series-15-5590-laptop_setup-guide_pt-br.pdf) (Thunderbolt 3 port)

### BIOS VERSION: Tested with **1.13.2** and **1.14.0** (Check your BIOS version before anything)

- Read [official guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) to understand stuff, not needed, but it's nice to understand what you're doing



#### BIOS SETUP:

- Virtualization Support -> Virtualization -> Check "Enable Intel Virtualization Technology"

#### OPENCORE SETUP:

- Choose EFI folder:
  - Debug: OpenCore will load in debug mode and print every step on screen and on file (located on EFI partition of USB disk)
  - Verbose: OpenCore with text only partition picker
  - OpenCanopy: OpenCore with GUI partition picker
  - OpenCanopy AudioDxe: OpenCore with GUI partition picker and boot chime sound on boot
  - Legacy BOOTx64: Use this if you don't want to change OpenCore entry on BIOS. I recommend using a version without BOOTx64.efi, loading OpenCore.efi directly. **Read section Updating from OpenCore 0.6.8**
- Open config.plist and make some changes:
  - If you want to enable verbose mode during installation, go to NVRAM->Add->7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82, and insert **-v** on **boot-args**. To disable verbose mode, just remove -v parameter.
  - Generate your **MacBookPro15,2** serials using [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS/) and insert it into your config.plist (under PlatformInfo->Generic). You need to update MLB, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID. 
  - It's recommended to [disable CFG Lock in bios using MobGrubShell](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html). If you disabled it, don't change the lines below. In case you don't want to mess with it, you have to change 2 properties under Kernel->Quirks:
    - AppleCpuPmCfgLock to **YES** or **1** 
    - AppleXcpmCfgLock to **YES** or **1**
    - If you want to disable CFG Lock and don't know how to dump your BIOS, use **setup_var_3 0x5C4 0x00** during the steps of [disabling CFG Lock in bios using MobGrubShell](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html). **only use it if your BIOS is in version 1.13.2 or 1.14.0, Dell could change this location on future updates.** 
    - **PLEASE DON'T USE THIS COMMAND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DELL G5 5590 WITH THE SPECS LISTED ABOVE, YOU COULD BRICK YOUR MACHINE.**
  - After installation you can make the default OpenCore selection by pressing Ctrl+Enter on the partition you want
  - You can also disable OpenCore boot picker under Misc->Boot->ShowPicker (change to NO).
  - **Remember to keep an USB copy of your EFI folder.** Normally I use one pen drive for tests, one pen drive with a working OpenCore version + macOS installer and last stable version on my SSD EFI Folder.

#### UNDERVOLTING:

The i7 9750h CPU supports undervolting, but it's not enabled by default in BIOS. In order to enable, you'll need to follow some steps, pretty similar to disable CFG Lock:

1. Format a USB drive to FAT32 on a GUID partition map.
2. Make a folder called EFI in the root of the USB
3. Inside this, make a folder called BOOT
4. Download [this](https://github.com/datasone/grub-mod-setup_var/releases/download/1.1/modGRUBShell.efi) file and place it inside BOOT
5. Rename this file to bootx64.efi
6. Boot into the USB drive (spam F12 at the BIOS prompt and select your USB drive)
7. Once this has loaded, enter **setup_var_3 0x660 0x00** to disable overclocking lock
8. Enter **reboot** to exit and restart your computer.

Now you have undervolting enabled. Next step: download VoltageShit (https://github.com/sicreative/VoltageShift) and extract it. I place the voltageshift folder inside Applications folder.

Next make some tests in order to define the best frequency for you. I got a very stable setup using -225mv CPU voltage offset ans -125mv on CPU Cache voltage offset. Start with -125mv in both and then try to rise CPU voltage offset to -225mv:

- Go to VoltageShift folder using terminal, in my case: `cd /Applications/voltageshift`
- Set the desired offset, example: `./voltageshift offset -125 0 -125` (first value is CPU, second value is GPU and third value is CPU Cache). You can try other values for best stability, starting with lower values and going up. If you set to high your laptop may freeze. In this case, hard restart and try again with lower values. Ideally you shoud start with `./voltageshift offset -25 0 -25` and step up 25mv each time. CPU voltage offset can be more than CPU cache offset. I read in a forum people getting good results with -225mv CPU and -125mv CPU cache. I got good results with it too and I'm using it for about a month without issues (I run -125mv CPU and -125mv CPU cache for a couple of months without issues too).
- After you test throughfuly the settings and are comfortable with System stability, you can apply the launchd in order to set undervolt on boot: `./voltageshift buildlaunchd -225 0 -125` (remember to set the CPU and CPU cache values with your desired values)
- There's some other parameters you can include on buildlaunchd, like run the utility every X minutes if your system is disabling undervolting after sleep, for example. I'm only running on boot and didn't have any issues so far. Read more at https://github.com/sicreative/VoltageShift

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Music.app don't work with DRM videos.
- Sometimes unplugging/replugging quickly causes laptop to crash. To avoid this issue, put laptop to sleep before plug or unplug the power chord. I'm revisiting all ACPI settings, but no luck so far.   ***Update: I found the cause. It's related to turning off dGPU. Leaving dGPU enabled, the issue is gone. Activating it with any method (-wegnogpu boot flag, optimus method, device method in config.plist, etc) will cause the freeze. I'm leaving dGPU disabled because battery life goes down to 30 minutes with it enabled, but you can disable it removing SSDT-dGPU-Off.aml from ACPI in config.plist. I'm looking for solutions to disable dGPU without freezing after unplug.**

## About

This is my "Hackintosh Diary", will be using it to maintain a triple boot Dell G5 5590 a80p between macOS, Arch Linux and Windows.  

Don't directly use my EFI folder, your computer won't boot cause it has CFG Lock disabled and other post install stuff.

Vanilla Boot could be accomplished using OPENCORE USB BOOT folder. Use this folder to make a bootable USB disk with macOS Catalina (tested with 10.5.5).

Used [Vanilla Laptop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/vanilla-laptop-guide/) from [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/), but laptop and desktop guide was merged into [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/).

Most work is done post installation, be prepared to read a lot. CFG Lock is difficult to understand but very simple to execute. Disabling CFG Lock and dGPU using [Optimus Method](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Laptops/laptop-disable.html#optimus-method) has major impact on battery life.

Follow [Vanilla Laptop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/vanilla-laptop-guide/) and use MacBookPro16,1 SMBIOS (remember to insert your generated data at platform info section). Setup config.plist using [Coffee Lake Plus](https://dortania.github.io/vanilla-laptop-guide/OpenCore/config-laptop.plist/coffee-lake-plus.html). Read every guide very carefully BEFORE start and know what you're going to do beforehand.

## Config

**ACPI changes:**

- SSNC-PLUG - CPU0 into PP00 -> Processor ID on this machine is PP00

**DELL SPECIFICS config.plist:**

- UpdateSMBIOSMode = Custom
- CustomSMBIOSGuid = True
- Audio layout-id = 15 (other channels worked, but 15 offered better stability and sound quality overall)

**Patching CFG Lock**

- Download BIOS from Dell website (version must be the same, variable can change after updates). 
- Dump bios with DecompNewDell.py (used Python3)
- Open dumped bios with UEFITool
- Search for "CFG Lock, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName)". Variable name come just after (in my case, using BIOS 1.13.2, was 0x5C4)

`One Of: CFG Lock, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): 0x5C4, VarStore: 0x1 [...]

The steps above I followed to find the correct CFG Lock variable name. After that, simply boot into Modified GRUB Shell and change variable from 0x5C4 to 0x00:

- Prepare EFI Boot Disk using [Disabling CFG Lock](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/extras/msr-lock#disabling-cfg-lock) instructions and patch using **setup_var_3 0x5C4 0x00**

**If you don't feel confortable messing with bios setting, just change the settings below in your config.plist:**

- AppleCpuPmCfgLock -> YES 
- AppleXcpmCfgLock -> YES 

**Generating serial numbers:**

Use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS/) script to generate your device serial number. Put it into PlatformInfo->Generic (MLB, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID).
